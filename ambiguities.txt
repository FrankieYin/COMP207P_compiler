Paragraph: 4
Problem: The set of "letters" that may present in the identifiers is not specified.
Solution: The lexer conforms to Java identifier specification, which accepts anything that's accepted by isJavaIdentifierPart().

Paragraph: 10
Problem: The spec does not specify how to deal with strings that span across multiple lines, e.g
"this is a string
that spans across two lines".
Solution: The scanner does not accept non-terminating string literals.

Paragraph: 21, 22
Problem: Two different assignment operators definition are used, namely "=" and ":=".
Solution: The scanner uses the later.

Paragraph: 5
Problem: "thread" and "function" are special types which the spec does not specify how to deal with in container classes.
Solution: They are accepted as type parameters in the container classes.

Paragraph: 17
Problem: It's not clear how to deal with lambda expressions that span across multiple lines.
Solution: 
- When the body of a lambda expression is a single expression, both the "return" keyword and braces "{}" can be omitted;
- When the body of a lambda expression is a block statement, the braces "{}" is required;
- Moreover, the body of a lambda expression may be empty, i.e. {}.

Paragraph: 15
Problem: Field or variable declaration in the examples are always followed by immediate initialisation.
Solution: The parser allows separate declaration and initialisation; however repeated declaration is not checked.
E.g 
>>>
int a; // this is allowed
int b = 0; // also allowed
...
int a = 1; // redeclaration is not checked
>>>

Paragraph: 15
Problem: The spec does not specify whether a multiple declaration can happen under a single type.
Solution: The parser accepts the following declaration and initialisation style (C style):
>>>
int a;
int a, b, c;
int a=0, b=1, c;
Person p = "Zhijun", "Yin", 19; // struct variable declaration and initialisation
>>>

Paragraph: 16
Problem: It is unclear whether "thread" can be a parameter type or not.
Solution: Since the examples involving threads in the spec suggest that the thread will automatically start on definition (declaration and initiation), I do not allow "thread" to be passed as a parameter to functions.

Paragraph: 15
Problem and Solution: This parser does not allow empty data type declaration list.
e.g.
>>>
tdef person {}; // not acceptable
>>>

Paragraph: 16
Problem and solution: Functions with empty body is allowed.

Paragraph: 24
Problem and solution: The body of a thread may be empty.

Paragraph: Table 4
Problem and solution: When assigning variables, multiple assignment is allowed.
E.g.
>>>
a = b = c = 1;
>>>

Paragraph: 22
Problem and solution: print statement may have empty clause, i.e.
>>>
print;
>>>
is allowed.

Paragraph: 24
Problem: wait and len are regarded as built-in function/attributes; however they are not keywords and should not be treated differently than any other identifiers.
Solution: My lexer ignore wait and len and simply treat them as normal identifiers.
